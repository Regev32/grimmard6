### Example<a name="example"></a>

The following example shows a working application with minimal setup. See the next section for working with your own data set. 

#### Example of a minimal **grimm-ard** application working.

There are sample freq. files and configuration files available in `example` directory. To use those example files for **grimm-ard**, follow:

##### Produce the needed graph and freq. files

The script will create the needed intermediary files in `output` directory and generate a graph pickle file needed for
the web application.

Run the python script:

```
cd setup
python3 produce_example_graph_file.py
```

output as it produces the needed files:

```

##### Start the application

Change to `app` directory and start the web app.

```
cd ../app
python3 app.py
```

##### Use Application

Visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to test out the application locally.

## Updating the Website<a name="updating-the-website"></a>

To update the Grim_ard website, you will need to follow these steps:

### Configuration File<a name="configuration-file"></a>

Ensure you have a JSON configuration file prepared. This file is crucial for configuring various aspects of the website.

See example file: [Configuration File](example/conf/minimal-configuration.json)

### HPF File<a name="hpf-file"></a>

Generate a HPF file from the freq. file based on configuration.

```python
from graph_generation.generate_hpf import produce_hpf

config_file = 'app/conf/conf.json'
produce_hpf(conf_file=config_file)
```

This will produce a `setup/output/hpf.csv`. The output directory should look as:

```
output
├── csv
├── hpf.csv
└── pop_counts_file.txt
```

The `output/pop_counts_file.txt` needs to be copied to `app/pop_ratio.txt`:

### Create Nodes/Edges files

From HPF file, create nodes/edges CSV files.

```python
from grim import grim

config_file = 'example/conf/minimal-configuration.json'

grim.graph_freqs(config_file)
```

You should see the nodes/edges CSV files.
```
|-- csv
|   |-- edges.csv
|   |-- info_node.csv
|   |-- nodes.csv
|   `-- top_links.csv

```

### Preparing the Incidence Graph<a name="preparing-the-incidence-graph"></a>

Using nodes/edges CSV files, produce a graph

```python
from generate_config_dict import generate_dict_config
from grim import grim

config_file = 'example/conf/minimal-configuration.json'
dict_config = generate_dict_config(config_file)

graph = grim.graph_instance(dict_config)
```

Ensure you have the `graph.pickle` file containing your graph instance. This pickle file will be used during the website
update process.

Save the graph as a pickle file in the `data/` directory.

```python
import pickle

with open('data/graph.pickle', 'wb') as pickle_file:
    pickle.dump(graph, pickle_file)
```

The frequency files also need to be imported and pickled with haplotype->freq dictionary to create a pickle file
in `app/freqs_dicts/all_freqs.pickle`.

Adapt the [example Python script](#example-of-a-minimal-grimm-ard-application-working) to your dataset.

### Configure application<a name="configure-app"></a>

Create `WEBSITE_CONFIG_FILE` and `GRIM_GRAPH` environment variables to point to config and pickled graph object file
relative to `app/` directory.

Change `WEBSITE_CONFIG_FILE` to the path of your configuration file.

```
export WEBSITE_CONFIG_FILE=my-website-configuration.json
```

Change `GRIM_GRAPH` to the path of the frequency graph you created and saved e.g. 'my-graph.pickle'.

```
export GRIM_GRAPH=my-graph.pickle
```

Here’s the text you can add to your **README** file:

---

### **Note: Using an Existing Graph**
If you **already have a graph**, you only need to run the Python script **`produce_example_graph_file.py`** starting from **Step 3** (**skip Step 1 and Step 2**).

#### **Required File Locations**
Make sure to place the necessary files in the correct directories:
- **Graph-related files** should be inside the **`csv`** directory.
- The **path for `csv`** should be:
  ```
  setup/output_new/csv
  ```
- The **population counts file (`pop_counts_file.txt`)** should be located at:
  ```
  setup/output_new/pop_counts_file.txt
  ```
- The **configuration file (`conf.json`)** should be placed at:
  ```
  app/conf/conf.json
  ```

Ensure that all required files are correctly placed before running the script.
